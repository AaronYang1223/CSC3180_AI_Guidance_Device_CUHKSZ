# Introduction
To help the blind people overcome the getting around problems, out group want to develop an AI guidance system based on reinforcement learning algorithm. The navigation is not a problem. We use radar as our sensor to train a model to help blind people avoid obstacles.For convenience and to verify the feasibility of our model, we use ML-Agents in Unity to train our model.
